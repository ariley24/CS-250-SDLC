How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  It is important to get as much information from the user as to what features they want to see and the overall functionality of the program. Creating user stories is a way to organize the user needs into actionable tasks. These user stories can then be ranked according by level of importance to ensure that the mose important needs are met first. This ensures that time a resources are being allocated appropriately so that all the user's needs are met.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 
  Prior to this course, my approach to developing software was a very traditional, waterfall approach. I spent a lot of time designing and planning the program, then started development, then finally tested. As expected, this created issues when bugs or other problems arose. After taking this course, I've switched to more of an agile approach. I now begin with a general idea of what I want the program to do, being development, test regularaly, and make changes when needed. I feel like this approach not only makes problem solving easier, but typically results in a better product as I have the ability to adapt the program throughout the development process. One aspect of agile I hope to incorporate into my furture development work is an information radiator, or a visual display of my "to-do", "in progress", and "completed" tasks.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
 
  Being a good team member means being able to communicate openly and clearly with the rest of your team. It means have a collabrative mindset, which means being open help from others and constructive criticism. Being a good team member means working hard to contribute to the project, and not relying on others to do your work for you. In other words, "carrying your own weight" and making sure you're a productive, reliable member of the team.
